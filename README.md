# Task-Tracker
An old archiver project of mine, developed as a part client request. A simple web-based Task Tracker built with **JavaScript**, **AngularJS**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. This project allows users to manage tasks, categorize them, and visualize task statistics with a live dashboard.

## Features
- **Task Management**
  - Add, delete, and mark tasks as completed
  - Categorize tasks (Work, Personal, Hobby, Other)
- **Dashboard / Analytics**
  - Displays total, completed, and pending tasks
  - Pie chart showing task distribution by category
- **Data Persistence**
  - Tasks are saved in the browser's `localStorage`
- **Responsive & Interactive**
  - Simple, clean UI with interactive updates

## Technologies Used
- AngularJS 1.x (pure JavaScript)
- HTML5 & CSS3
- Chart.js for analytics
- LocalStorage for data persistence
